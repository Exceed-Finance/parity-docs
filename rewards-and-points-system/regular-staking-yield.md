# Regular Staking Yield

Regular Staking with Exceed provides a **transparent, predictable, and real-time yield** on your staked assets (SOL or USDC). Unlike other protocols where yields can be opaque or backward-looking, Exceed ensures users always know exactly what they’re earning.

## How It Works

#### Weekly Updates

Yield is updated **every Monday**, based on the protocol’s performance from the previous week.

#### Forward-Looking Rates

The APY you see on the Exceed app is the **actual yield you will earn** during the current week — not a historical estimate.

#### Auto-Compounded

All yields are shown as **annualized, compounded rates**, meaning they account for reinvestment over time.

#### Transparent Inputs

Yields are derived from the underlying performance of Exceed’s synthetic yield engines — including JLP trading commissions, funding rates, and validator rewards. See the High-Yielding Synthetic USDC and SOL sections for an explanation of yield sources. &#x20;
