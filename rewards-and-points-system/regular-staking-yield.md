# Regular Staking Yield

Regular Staking with Exceed provides a **transparent, predictable, and real-time yield** on your staked assets (SOL or USDC). Unlike other protocols where yields can be opaque or backward-looking, Exceed ensures users always know exactly what they’re earning.

## How It Works

#### Weekly Updates

Yield is updated **every Monday**, based on the protocol’s performance from the previous week.

#### Forward-Looking Rates

The APY you see on the Exceed app is the **actual yield you will earn** during the current week — not a historical estimate.

#### Auto-Compounded

All yields are shown as **annualized, compounded rates**, meaning they account for reinvestment over time.

#### Transparent Inputs

Yields are derived from the underlying performance of Exceed’s synthetic yield engines — including JLP trading commissions, funding rates, and validator rewards. See the High-Yielding Synthetic USDC and SOL sections for an explanation of yield sources.&#x20;

#### **Token Incentives**

Exceed **rewards regular stakers with FXT points**, calculated in real-time and added continuously to user balances.

#### **Real-Time Calculation**

Every **5 seconds**, the protocol compares actual in-kind yield to target APY. The difference is minted as FXT points at a 100:1 ratio to future tokens

#### **FDV Valuation Schedule**

Initial rewards are **calculated at a $50M FDV**. The valuation escalates progressively to $100M, so earlier participants lock in more favorable conversion terms.

#### **Program Duration**

Incentives phase out automatically as TVL grows, **rewarding the earliest stakers** with the maximum benefits.

#### **Vesting schedule**&#x20;

Once FXT Points convert into Exceed Tokens at TGE:

* **30% unlocks immediately**
* **70% vests linearly over 9 months**, starting after a 3-month cliff.
