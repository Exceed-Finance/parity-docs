# Tokenomics Overview

Parity's tokenomics are designed with **long-term alignment and transparency** in mind. There are **100 billion tokens** in total, with distribution centered around users and long-term growth — not short-term speculation.

## Key Principles

#### Community Eats First

Users are at the heart of the Parity ecosystem. The largest share of tokens is allocated to users via the FPT Points system, rewarding early participation and long-term engagement.

#### Clear, Real-Time Rewards

Unlike most points programs, FPT Points are **fully transparent** and **simple**:

* 1 FPT Point = 1 Parity Token at TGE
* Your token rewards are updated in real time
* TGE timing is public and TVL-dependent ($300M target) — no uncertainty

#### Team-Aligned, Long-Term

The team is on a **4-year vesting schedule**, with:

* 1-year cliff
* 3 years of daily linear unlocks

This reflects deep commitment to building the protocol for the long haul — not cashing out early.

#### Built by the Team, For the Users

Parity is founded by builders who are also users — and who are designing the system they wish existed. The result is a protocol where users come first, and ownership is earned through contribution.

#### Community-Funded, Not VC-Driven

Parity is currently **self-funded by founders**. While the protocol may raise **strategic venture capital** in the future, it will be **limited to 2–4%** of total token supply at most — preserving the protocol's **user-owned** foundation.
