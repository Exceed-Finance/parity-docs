# Founders Reserve

The Founders Reserve is an **exclusive group** of early supporters who gain access to premium benefits and long-term alignment with Exceed’s future. A total of **500 seats** are available — split between **Lifetime Seats** and **Competitive Seats** — each granting elevated rewards, governance power, and recognition within the protocol. See the Founders Reserve Section for more details.&#x20;

## Benefits of the Founders Reserve

Members of the Founders Reserve receive:

* **Exclusive access** — limited to 500 seats
* **Revenue share** — earn 5% of protocol fees
* **Higher staking APYs** — 15% boost
* **Governance** — vote and help shape the future of Exceed
* **Transferable access** — seats are represented as NFTs

## How to Qualify

There are two ways to earn a seat:

#### **1. Lifetime Seat (100 seats total)**

Earn or purchase **30 million FXT Points** to secure a **permanent, non-revocable seat**. Once you meet the requirement, the seat is yours for life, regardless of future activity.

#### **2. Competitive Seat (400 seats total)**

Hold at least **2 million FXT Points** and maintain a **500-day staking streak** to claim a Competitive Seat.

These seats are **yours to lose** — meaning:

* You keep your seat as long as you maintain eligibility (staking streak + token holdings)
* You only lose your seat if you withdraw, sell, or break your streak

Both tracks follow a **first-past-the-line** principle: Seats are allocated in real time to users who meet the criteria first. Once filled, further participants will need to wait for a seat to open up.
{% endhint %}

## Live Leaderboard

A **real-time leaderboard** will be available in the dApp, showing:

* How many Lifetime and Competitive Seats remain
* Your current standing vs. others
* How close you are to qualifying

This ensures full transparency and allows users to track progress and stay competitive in real time.

## Two Ways to Get In

#### Stake Your Way In

Stake SOL or USDC through **Reserve Staking** to earn **FXT Points** and build your **staking streak**. This lets you progress naturally toward a Competitive or Lifetime Seat.
