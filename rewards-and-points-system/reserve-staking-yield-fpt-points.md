# Reserve Staking Yield (FPT Points)

Reserve Staking offers the highest rewards in the Parity ecosystem — with yield paid in **FPT Points**, the future native token of the protocol.

## How FPT Yield Works

#### FPT Points = Parity Tokens

Each FPT Point will convert 1:1 into Parity Tokens at Token Generation Event (TGE).

#### APY in FPT Points

Your yield is calculated based on the amount staked and a target APY (e.g. 50–100%), using a fixed reference token price:

{% hint style="info" %}
**$0.005 per token**, based on a target $500M FDV.
{% endhint %}

#### Formula:

Staked Amount × APY ÷ Token Price = FPT Points Earned

#### TGE Timeline:

The protocol will only conduct its TGE once it surpasses **$300M in TVL**, aligning with a target valuation of $300M–$2B.

### Dynamic & Competitive

The APY for Reserve Staking is **set by the protocol** and may evolve over time.

* Designed to remain **attractive and competitive**
* Calibrated to reward **early adopters and long-term supporters**

### Vesting Schedule

Once FPT Points convert into Parity Tokens at TGE:

* **30% unlocks immediately**
* **70% vests linearly over 12 months**, **starting after a 3-month cliff**

This structure ensures a healthy balance between liquidity and long-term alignment.

### Additional Notes

* **FPT Points are non-transferable**
* They **accrue passively through Reserve Staking**
* They can also be **purchased via the Founders Reserve tab** for users who wish to accelerate accumulation — whether to secure a **Founders Reserve seat** or simply build a larger future stake
* FPT Points represent a growing **stake in the future of the protocol**
