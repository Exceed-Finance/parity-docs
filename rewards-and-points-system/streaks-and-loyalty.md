# Streaks & Loyalty

**Streaks** are Exceed’s loyalty system — a transparent and consistent way to reward long-term participation in both **Regular** and **Reserve** staking. By staking daily, users earn Streaks that unlock higher yields, increase engagement, and pave the way to exclusive benefits like the **Founders Reserve**.

## How Streaks Work

* You earn **1 Streak per day** for each staking mode:
  * 1 Streak for Regular Staking
  * 1 Streak for Reserve Staking
* That means you can earn up to **2 Streaks per day**
* More ways to earn Streaks (e.g. through referrals) are coming soon

{% hint style="info" %}
You can stake as little or as much as you like to earn Streaks. Even staking just 10 USDC qualifies — this system rewards consistency, not capital size.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Streaks are awarded per staking mode, not per asset. So even if you stake both pikSOL and pikUSDC, you will earn 1 Regular Streak per day.
{% endhint %}

## Rewards & Milestones

Streaks aren’t just about long-term goals — users are rewarded progressively. As your streak count grows, your APY increases across **both Regular and Reserve staking**.

| Streaks | Days of Staking (at 2/day) | APY Boost    |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| 100     | \~50 days                  | **+5% APY**  |
| 200     | \~100 days                 | **+10% APY** |
| 300     | \~150 days                 | **+15% APY** |

Loyalty-based APY boosts are distributed separately from the core yield through the Claim Portal, ensuring full fungibility of Exceed’s LSTs.

## Progress Toward Founders Reserve

At **500 Streaks** (currnetly achievable in \~250 days at the 2/day max), users become eligible for a Competitive Seat in the Founders Reserve, provided they also meet the required FXT Points threshold.

Streaks are not just a yield boost — they are your path to long-term status, protocol-level perks, and deeper alignment with Exceed.
{% endhint %}

The Streak counter caps at 55&#x30;**.**

## Withdrawals & Streak Penalties

To keep the system fair and reward long-term engagement:

* You can withdraw up to **5% of your stake per week** with **no penalty**
* If you withdraw **more than 5%**, you will incur a **proportional Streak reduction**

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: Withdrawing 50% of your position results in 50% fewer Streaks
{% endhint %}

This ensures flexibility for users who need liquidity, while maintaining strong incentives for ongoing participation.
