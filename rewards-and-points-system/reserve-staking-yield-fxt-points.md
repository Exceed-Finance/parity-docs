# Reserve Staking Yield (FXT Points)

Reserve Staking offers the highest rewards in the Exceed ecosystem — with yield paid in **FXT Points**, the future native token of the protocol.

## How FXT Yield Works

#### FXT Points = Exceed Tokens

100 FXT Points will convert into 1 Exceed Token at the Token Generation Event (TGE).

#### APY in FXT Points

Your yield is calculated based on the amount staked and a target APY (e.g. 50–100%), using a fixed reference token price:

{% hint style="info" %}
**$0.005 per token**, based on a target $500M FDV.
{% endhint %}

#### Formula:

Staked Amount × APY ÷ Token Price = FXT Points Earned

#### TGE Timeline:

The protocol will only conduct its TGE once it surpasses **$300M in TVL**, aligning with a target valuation of $500M–$2B.

### Dynamic & Competitive

The APY for Reserve Staking is set by the protocol as a multiple of regular staking yield and may evolve over time. It is Calibrated to reward **early adopters and long-term supporters.**

### Vesting Schedule

Once FXT Points convert into Exceed Tokens at TGE:

* **30% unlocks immediately**
* **70% vests linearly over 9 months**, **starting after a 3-month cliff**

### Additional Notes

* **FXT Points are non-transferable**
* They **accrue passively through Reserve Staking**
* They can also be **purchased via the Founders Reserve tab** for users who wish to accelerate accumulation — whether to secure a **Founders Reserve seat** or simply build a larger future stake
* FXT Points represent a growing **stake in the future of the protocol**
