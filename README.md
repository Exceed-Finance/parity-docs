## What is Exceed?

**Exceed is a Stablecoin Yield and Synthetic Staking platform** redefining how on-chain yield is generated and accesse&#x64;**.** It is a **vertically integrated protocol** — spanning proprietary yield engines, a developer SDK, and a user-friendly frontend — built to deliver the highest yields for both institutional users and crypto-native participants.

Inspired by smart beta ETFs in traditional finance, Exceed applies systematic, rules-based yield generation to crypto — enhancing returns while maintaining transparency and simplicity.

#### Smarter, More Flexible, and More Rewarding Staking

We aim to make staking smarter, more flexible, and more rewarding — while keeping the experience simple, predictable, and fully transparent. Exceed acts as an infrastructure layer that upgrades how crypto assets are staked and used, unlocking better outcomes for users without adding complexity.

#### Dynamic Allocation

Unlike traditional staking solutions that are static and low-yielding, Exceed **dynamically allocates** capital between validator rewards and synthetic yield modules. This means users always earn the most competitive return possible — in both bullish and bearish markets — without needing to actively manage anything.

## What is Synthetic Staking?

**Synthetic staking** is an advanced but transparent approach to staking. With Exceed, users earn not only blockchain security rewards (validator yield) but also market-based rewards, such as funding fees paid by traders. These two sources of yield are seamlessly combined through automated, rules-based logic.

When users stake with Exceed, they help secure both blockchains and crypto markets, contributing to greater stability across the ecosystem — and in return, they earn superior rewards.

In practice, users receive a **synthetic liquid staking token (sLST)** — such as **pikSOL** or **pikUSDC** — which grows in value over time, just like traditional LSTs. The user experience mirrors that of staking with popular protocols on Solana today, with no extra steps or complexity.

## Why Exceed Exists

Staking, in its current form, leaves much to be desired. Yields are typically low, inflexible, and unresponsive to real-time market conditions. On the other hand, many newer “yield-enhancing” protocols introduce unnecessary complexity, lack transparency, rely on directional trading, and often do not offer principal protection — exposing users to avoidable risk.

Exceed takes a different path.

We’re building a robust, transparent infrastructure layer designed to:

* **Maximize staking efficiency** in a predictable, risk-conscious way
* **Deliver higher returns** through systematic, rule-based synthetic yield infrastructure
* **Maintain simplicity and transparency** at every level of the user experience

## Why You Should Care

#### Higher, More Sustainable Yields

Exceed is launching with **25% APY on SOL** and **20% APY on USDC,** partly funded with token incentives

#### Proven Performance

V1 has been live on Solana mainnet (private beta) since October 2024, consistently outperforming all benchmarks

#### Simple UX, Smarter Back-End

Familiar staking experience with transparent, automated optimization behind the scenes

## How It Works (At a Glance)

1. You deposit SOL or USDC
2. Exceed mints a synthetic liquid staking token (e.g. pikSOL, pikUSDC)
3. Your assets are dynamically allocated to either validator staking or synthetic yield modules — depending on which offers better performance
4. The value of your sLST increases over time relative to the underlying asset, reflecting accrued yield
5. Withdraw anytime — standard withdrawals settle in 24–48 hours, or choose instant withdrawal (for a small fee) via our liquidity network
