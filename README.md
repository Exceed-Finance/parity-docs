# Parity Finance Overview

## Overview

**Parity** is a decentralized stablecoin protocol offering a high-yield, stable, and secure alternative in the stablecoin space. Built on **Solana**, Parity provides users with an **attractive 20% APY** through innovative delta-neutral strategies, positioning itself as a leader in the synthetic stablecoin market.

At the heart of Parity is the **Parity Dollar (PUSD)**, a stablecoin backed by delta-neutral strategies like **Hedged JLP** (Jupiter Liquidity Provider) and the **Solana Basis trade**. These strategies ensure the stability of PUSDâ€™s peg while generating consistent yield, making it an ideal asset for DeFi traders, liquidity providers, and crypto treasuries.

PUSD and sPUSD, the Parity Deposit Token, are designed to be the go-to assets for on-chain collateral and trade settlement, offering users a safe, high-yield alternative to traditional stablecoins.
