# How to stake with Exceed

## Choose Your Staking Mode

This is the first screen you’ll see in the Exceed dApp - the staking tab. You’ll start by choosing between two staking modes — depending on your yield goals and preferences.

### Regular Staking

Choose **Regular Staking** to earn yield through synthetic liquid staking tokens — **pikSOL** and **pikUSDC**. These tokens **grow in value over time** relative to their underlying assets. It’s a simple option designed for users who want to passively benefit from Exceed’s synthetic staking engine without needing to actively manage anything.

PiK stands for “Payment-in-Kind” — meaning your rewards are paid in the same token you deposit.
{% endhint %}

### Reserve Staking

For users seeking **higher APYs** and **deeper participation** in the Exceed ecosystem, **Reserve Staking** offers an advanced path. When staking in Reserve mode, users receive **pitSOL** or **pitUSDC** — tokens that stay **pegged 1:1** to the underlying asset. Instead of growing in value, rewards are accrued as **FXT Points** (Future Exceed Tokens), which can later be redeemed 1:1 for Exceed Tokens at TGE.

PiT stands for “Payment-in-Token” — rewards are paid in FXT Points rather than in-kind.

**3. Reserve Staking**\
Reserve Staking lets you stake SOL or USDC to receive pitSOL or pitUSDC - synthetic liquid staking tokens (sLSTs) that stay 1:1 with their underlying asset, while earning FXT Points redeemable 1:1 for Exceed Tokens at TGE. Selecting “Stake” will take you directly to the Reserve Staking tab.
