**6. Lifetime Seats Counter**\

**7. Competitive Seats Counter**\
Displays how many of the 400 competitive seats are still available. These seats can be earned by reaching 2 million FPT Points (through reserve staking or purchase) and maintaining a 500-day staking streak. If you **withdraw** or **lose eligibility**, your seat may be reallocated to someone else who meets the criteria. You **keep your seat** even if others qualify **as long as** you **don’t break your streak** or **sell** your FPT / Parity Tokens. The explainer on streaks is in another section.
