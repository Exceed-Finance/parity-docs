# Switch Tokens

## Switch Tokens Tab

The Switch Tokens tab allows you to seamlessly convert between respective Regular and Reserve staking tokens at any time. This lets you change staking modes and / or your staking assets without unstaking or interrupting your staking streak.

**1. Token Selection Tab**\
Choose which token pair you want to switch between, either SOL-based or USDC-based.

**2. Amount to Switch**\
Enter the amount of your current staking token you'd like to switch from. You can click “MAX” to use your full available balance.

**3. Tokens Recieved**\
Displays the token and amount you will receive after the switch based on the current exchange rate and a switching fee if applicable. A switching fee is only applied when switching between sLSTs with different underlying assets, i.e. switching between USDC-based and SOL-based sLSTs.  &#x20;

**4. Switch Button**\
After entering your amount, click Switch and confirm the transaction in your wallet. The new tokens will be available in your wallet instantly.

**6. Arrow Button**\
Click the arrow to toggle between matching tokens (e.g., pikSOL ↔ pitSOL), and switch staking modes.
