# Reserve Staking

## Reserve Staking Tab

For users seeking **higher APYs** and **deeper participation** in the Exceed ecosystem, Reserve Staking offers an advanced path. When staking in Reserve mode, users receive **pitSOL** or **pitUSDC** — tokens that stay pegged 1:1 to the underlying asset. Instead of growing in value, rewards are accrued as **FXT Points** (Future Exceed Tokens), which can later be redeemed 1:1 for Exceed Tokens at TGE. Choose your asset, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction to begin earning.

**1. Token Selection Tabs**\
Switch between staking SOL or USDC. Your choice determines whether you receive pitSOL or pitUSDC.

**2. Stake/Unstake Toggle**\
Choose whether you want to deposit new funds (Stake) or begin the withdrawal process (Unstake).

**3. Amount to Stake**\
Enter how much SOL or USDC you want to stake. You can also click "MAX" to use your full available balance. Click "Stake" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Upon confirmation, pitSOL or pitUSDC will automatically appear in your wallet.

**4. Tokens Received**\
Shows the amount of pitSOL or pitUSDC you'll receive based on the amount you've entered. SOL and USDC are always 1:1 with pitSOL and pitUSDC.

**5. Stake Button**\
After entering your amount, click Stake and confirm the transaction in your wallet to initiate staking.

**6. Arrow Button**\
This button lets you toggle between staking and unstaking modes. If you want to unstake, pitSOL will be converted back into SOL at the displayed exchange rate minus a small withdrawal fee, as displayed on the screen.

**7. FXT Points Badge**\
Shows the number of FXT Points you’ve earned or purchased. FXT Points are redeemable for Exceed Tokens at a 1:1 ratio on TGE.

**8. Wallet Button**\
Shows the connected wallet and allows you to manage wallet interactions (e.g. switch accounts or disconnect).

**9. Back Button**\
Takes you back to the previous screen where you choose between Regular and Reserve staking strategies.

## Reserve Unstaking Tab

By clicking the "Unstake" toggle, the interface switches to enable you to unstake your funds. The Reserve Unstaking screen allows you to redeem your pitSOL / pitUSDC for SOL / USDC respectively.&#x20;

After selecting the amount you wish to unstake and confirming the transaction, your request enters a 48-hour withdrawal window. You’ll be able to monitor and manage your pending withdrawals directly from this screen.
