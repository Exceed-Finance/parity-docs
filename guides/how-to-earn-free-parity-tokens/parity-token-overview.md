# Parity Token Overview

## Overview

The **Parity Token** is a Solana-based asset that forms the backbone of the Parity Finance ecosystem. With a fixed supply of **15 billion tokens**, it empowers governance decisions and offers holders unique benefits within the protocol. As a governance and utility token, the Parity Token enables participation in protocol decision-making and may provide privileged access to certain features and opportunities within the ecosystem. The token’s design aligns the interests of the Parity community, early users and other key stakeholders ensuring a long-term commitment to the protocol's success.

## Governance & Utility

While the protocol is still evolving, Parity Token holders will likely play a significant role in the future governance of the platform. Potential voting rights could include decisions about yield mechanisms, reserve management, and the overall direction of the protocol. In addition, the protocol may offer privileged access to its USD Staking module, allowing token holders to enjoy increased staking quotas or higher yields—further enhancing the value of holding Parity Tokens.

## High Revenue Generation & Token Burns&#x20;

Parity Finance is a profitable protocol, driven in part by its involvement with the **Jupiter Perps DEX**, one of the biggest revenue-generating platforms across all of DeFi. Parity aims to capture a significant portion of the JLP pool, where 75% of fees go to liquidity providers (LPs).

The high revenue generation supports user rewards and protocol sustainability. The protocol's profitability is a key factor driving **buybacks and burns**, which in turn, could reduce the token supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens. Once Parity is well-established, the protocol will likely dedicate a portion of revenues to buybacks and burns, ensuring that the circulating supply of Parity Tokens decreases over time.

## Comparable Protocols

We regard Jupiter and Ethena as our closest peers. **Jupiter** currently commands an FDV of **$9.4 billion**, and Ethena is projected to reach up to **$100 billion+** FDV, according to analysis done by Arthur Hayes. These protocols operate in a similar space, and Parity is well-positioned to grow together with the Jupiter ecosystem, as well as capture a significant share of the Solana stablecoin and DeFi TVL.  &#x20;

## PT-Staking

The only way to acquire **Parity Tokens** is by staking PUSD through the Parity protocol at [app.parityusd.fi](http://app.parityusd.fi). Tokens are awarded at no cost to users, and users always keep their principal. **Parity Token rewards** accumulate based on a simple and transparent formula—see the previous tab for more details.

As the protocol’s TVL grows, the FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) and thus the price of Parity Tokens are expected to rise. This creates an advantage for early users of the protocol, who receive Parity Tokens at lower effective prices. The table below illustrates the projected price per Parity Token at various FDV levels:

| FDV at This Price Level | Token Price at This Level |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 50 $m                   | 0.0033 $                  |
| 60 $m                   | 0.0040 $                  |
| 70 $m                   | 0.0047 $                  |
| 80 $m                   | 0.0053 $                  |
| 90 $m                   | 0.0060 $                  |
| 100 $m                  | 0.0067 $                  |

For context, comparable protocols like **Ethena** and **Jupiter** currently have token prices of **$0.34** and **$0.78**, respectively—**100-200x higher** than Parity Token’s price at current levels.

## Transparency & Caution

It’s important to remember the actual value of Parity Tokens will depend on user adoption, market conditions, and protocol performance. **Parity Finance does not guarantee any specific token price or returns** and encourages users to perform their own due diligence.
