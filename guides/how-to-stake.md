# How to Stake

## Staking Module

The Parity protocol offers users two staking options for their PUSD. You can stake your PUSD in either (or a combination) of the following ways:

* **PT Staking**: Stake your PUSD to earn **free Parity Tokens**. Your principal remains intact, and you receive Parity Tokens at no cost, based on an attractive implied Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
* **USD Staking**: Stake your PUSD to earn rewards in USDC.
