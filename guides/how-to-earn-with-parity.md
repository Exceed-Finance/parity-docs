## Steps to earn:

Getting started with Parity is simple. Follow these steps to begin earning rewards:

1. **Mint Parity Dollars (PUSD)**\
   Visit [app.parityusd.fi](http://app.parityusd.fi) and connect your wallet. You can mint Parity Dollars (PUSD) at a 1:1 ratio with USDCâ€”there are no fees involved. Simply enter the amount of USDC you wish to swap into PUSD and click "Mint."
2. **Stake Your PUSD**\
   Once you've minted PUSD, head over to the "Stake" tab. Here, you can choose between two staking options:

* **USD Yield**: Earn 20% APY in USDC.
* **Parity Token**: Earn 20% yield in free Parity Tokens.

3. **No Lock-Ups, No Fees**\
   Parity Protocol offers full flexibility. You can unstake your PUSD at any time, with no lock-ups, cooldown periods, or fees. You keep all rewards earned, and your funds are available immediately. Additionally, you can redeem your PUSD for USDC at any time at a 1:1 ratio with no fees.

The protocol has three key modules:

1. **Mint-Redeem Module**: Mint and redeem PUSD with USDC.
2. **PT-Staking**: Stake PUSD to earn free Parity Tokens.
3. **USD Staking**: Stake PUSD to earn rewards in USDC.

Further details on each of these modules can be found in the sections that follow.
