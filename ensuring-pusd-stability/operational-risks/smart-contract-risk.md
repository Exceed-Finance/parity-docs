# Smart Contract Risk

## **Understanding Smart Contract Risk**

In decentralized finance (DeFi), **smart contract risk** refers to the possibility that a vulnerability or bug in the protocol's code could be exploited, potentially leading to the loss of funds or unintended behavior. Since smart contracts are self-executing and irreversible, it is crucial that they are rigorously tested and audited to minimize these risks.

At Parity Finance, we recognize the importance of addressing smart contract risks head-on. That’s why the protocol has undergone multiple security audits and continues to be monitored by trusted third-party firms. By taking proactive measures, such as expanding our testing framework and continuously improving our codebase, we ensure that Parity’s smart contracts are secure, and reliable for all users.



**Jupiter Perps: Battle-Tested and Audited for Maximum Security**

Jupiter and JLP are core components of the Parity ecosystem, with a proven track record in decentralized finance. JLP has been operational for over a year, boasting a market cap of over $700 million and growing steadily. This liquidity pool is an integral part of Jupiter Perps DEX, a highly regarded protocol known for its security and performance. Continuous risk monitoring by platforms like Chaos Labs and Gauntlet provides real-time assessments, further enhancing the safety of the ecosystem.

Jupiter Perps DEX itself has undergone rigorous audits by respected blockchain security firms to ensure the integrity of its smart contracts. Notable audits include:

* [OtterSec Perpetual Audit Report](https://station.jup.ag/assets/files/ottersec_perpetual_audit_report-573977253c463e70541dda93ac533d0b.pdf)
* [Sec3 Perpetual Audit Report](https://station.jup.ag/assets/files/sec3_perpetual_audit_report-cfbe25c6ce179ab95a84c2ffe93b5ac5.pdf)

These comprehensive audits provide thorough security assessments of Jupiter’s perpetual protocol, focusing on smart contract vulnerabilities, governance structures, and system functionality. The results confirm Jupiter's high standards of security, offering additional peace of mind.

**Parity's Smart Contracts: Audited Twice, Built for Security**

To ensure the security of Parity’s stablecoin and staking systems, Parity Finance has undergone two audits, the latest of which was conducted by Quantstamp, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit found that the Parity codebase is well-structured, adheres to best practices, and does not contain any critical security vulnerabilities.

**Key Findings from Quantstamp Audit**:

* **Code Quality**: The smart contracts were praised for their clarity and maintainability.
* **Improvements**: While no critical issues were found, the audit recommended expanding testing coverage to include more edge cases. The Parity team has since addressed these concerns and updated validation processes.
