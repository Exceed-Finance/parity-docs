# Synthetic Staking

## What is Synthetic Staking?

Synthetic staking is an **advanced but transparent approach to staking.** With Parity, users earn not only **blockchain security rewards** (validator yield) but also **market-based rewards,** such as funding fees paid by traders. These two sources of yield are seamlessly combined through automated, rules-based logic.

#### Securing The Blockchain & The Markets

When users stake with Parity, they help secure both blockchains and crypto markets, contributing to greater stability across the ecosystem — and in return, they earn superior rewards.

#### Recieve Your sLST

In practice, when staking with Parity **users receive a synthetic liquid staking token (sLST)** — such as pikSOL or pikUSDC — which grows in value over time, just like traditional LSTs. The user experience mirrors that of staking with popular protocols on Solana today, with no extra steps or complexity.
