# Risk at Exceed

Exceed **is a synthetic yield infrastructure.** Our architecture is designed from the ground up to deliver high-yielding, crypto-native assets — with risk controls embedded at every layer of the system.

## How We Manage Risk

#### Built-In Stability

Exceed's synetheic LSTs are redeemable at par value for the underlying assets at any time. Every synthetic token is backed by yield-generating collateral.

#### Delta-Neutral & Pegged by Design

Through derivatives and dynamic exposure management, the protocol maintains delta-neutrality and full SOL exposure — keeping value stable in USD terms for USDC-based synthetic assets and in SOL terms for SOL-based ones.

#### Automatic Yield Adaptation

Our infrastructure adapts to markets in real time. When validator yields or benchmark stablecoin rates outperform market-based sources (e.g. fees, funding), Exceed reallocates automatically — ensuring users always earn competitive returns.

#### Liquidity-First Architecture

Underlying collateral is liquid and composable. Even during market stress, collateral can be efficiently unwound with minimal cost — ensuring timely redemption.

#### Secure & Transparent Custody

Colalteral is held in institutional-grade, non-custodial wallets (Fireblocks). This setup minimizes both operational and custodial risk.

#### TradFi-Backed Fallbacks

In extreme scenarios, the protocol can shift colateral into Franklin Templeton’s tokenized treasury Benji fund, providing a crypto-to-TradFi safety rail that anchors value to regulated, USD-denominated assets.

#### Audited, Battle-Tested Code

All smart contracts have been audited by top-tier security firms and rigorously tested. Ongoing monitoring and structured internal reviews ensure continued protocol integrity. Check our latest aduit by Quantstamp here:
